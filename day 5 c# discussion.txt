Day 5 c# discussion


Interfaces :
definition : interfaces is a contract class and methods 
interfaces objects can not be created.
no constrctors, no fields
create properties inside interfaces
interfaces can be inherited  I1 : I2
inteface objects can be created, but by instatiating with a class


Abstract classes : 
definition : abstract classes contains atleast 1 abstract method and many 
non abstract methods .

abstract class objects can not be created. 
can have constructors, fields, properties etc
abstract classes can be inherited              
eg: 
   abstract class A
   {
          ..........
   }
  abstract class B : A                //possible 
   {
          ..........
   }
by default , we have to inherit abstract class

Partial class : 

- special feature in c#
- this will helps us to implement the functionality of a single class into multiple files
-- and then all these files are combined in to a single class file when the application is getting
--compiled 

Static class : 
  static class, static variables, static methods 
- static keyword
- we can create objects of static class since it does not allow to create objects 
- static classed are sealed class 


Generics : 
   Generic class : this will allow the use to define classes and methods with the placeholder. 
c# 2.0 introduced 
Generics allows to get the data in the particular data types 


Differences : 

indexers 
  this keyword 
  they are identified by signatures 
  they are accessed using indexes 
  indexers can not be static

properties 
  get, set -accessors
  return, setting the value 
  these are accessed by names 
  can be static
